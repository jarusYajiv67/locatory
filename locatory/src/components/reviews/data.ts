The Subway outlet was less crowded and we had dining area to wait until we got the food.\nService was good. Friendly and helpful staff who helped with the choice of the wrap.\nSeating space was convenient and well light.",

    "text": "Very less staff. Keeping their customers waiting for long time they sincerely work hard for Zomato and Swiggy. Very sad state of affairs. Due to this issue they forgot to prepare proper Sub for us today 11.09.2022. They are unable to concentrate on dine in customers as online orders are flooding. Better put a board  \"ONLY ONLINE ORDERS, CLOSED FOR DINE IN\"",
